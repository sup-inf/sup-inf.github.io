Artificial neurons, which are elementary units in an ANN, appears to have been first introduced by McCulloch and Pitts in 1943 to demonstrate the biological neurons using algorithms and mathematics. An ANN is based on a set of connected artificial neurons. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. Since the early work of Hebb, who proposed cell assembly theory which attempted to explain synaptic plasticity, considerable effort has been devoted to ANNs. Though perceptron was created by Rosenblatt for pattern recognition by training an adaptive  McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, it is incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. A key trigger for renewed interest in neural networks and learning was Werbos’s back-propagation algorithm, which makes the training of multi-layer networks feasible and efficient.<br></p></div><a href="/2019/02/01/neural-network/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li><li class="post-list-item"><article class="post-block"><h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2019/01/24/genetic-algorithm/" class="post-title-link">Genetic Algorithm-Assignment</a></h2><div class="post-info">Jan 24, 2019</div><div class="post-content"><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>Inspired by the process of natural selection and principle of genetics, genetic algorithms are implemented to handle various optimization problems. Basic theorem and  mathematical derivation has given by J. H. Holland. This research report is intended as a solution, performing optimization on two fitness functions. The reminder of this report is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant fundamentals of genetic algorithm, which includes the detailed structure with its component parts. In Section 3, the maximal of two fitness function are given with the optimal populations which contain exhaustive revolutionary process. Conclusions of the report are presented in Section 4.<br></p></div><a href="/2019/01/24/genetic-algorithm/" class="read-more">...more</a></article></li></ul></main><footer><div class="paginator"></div><div class="copyright"><p>© 2019 <a href="https://rm-rf.moe">hsm</a>, powered by <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank">Hexo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo" target="_blank">hexo-theme-apollo</a>.</p></div></footer></div><script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML" integrity="sha384-crwIf/BuaWM9rM65iM+dWFldgQ1Un8jWZMuh3puxb8TOY9+linwLoI7ZHZT+aekW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
